Create a comprehensive WordPress cache benchmarking plugin that helps users scientifically test and compare the performance of different cache configurations. Build a sophisticated benchmarking engine that measures response times, memory usage, database queries, and cache hit rates across multiple iterations, with real-time server resource monitoring that tracks CPU usage, RAM consumption, and disk I/O throughout each test to provide deep insights into how caching affects server performance.
Design a cache profile system that allows users to create different plugin configurations for testing. When creating a profile, display all installed WordPress plugins and allow users to select any combination to test together. Implement intelligent plugin state management that activates only the selected plugins for testing, then carefully restores the original configuration afterward by only deactivating plugins that weren’t previously active and reactivating plugins that were previously active, ensuring benchmarking doesn’t disrupt the site’s normal operation.
Implement a powerful stress test feature that pushes WordPress to its limits by performing intensive operations like creating 100 posts with random content and metadata, reading them via the WP REST API, repeatedly reloading WordPress options from the database with forced cache deletions, and simulating cron jobs that write 1MB files to disk every second. This comprehensive test should reveal how cache configurations handle real-world high-load scenarios, with automatic cleanup of all test data after completion.
Build a comparison system that lets users select 2-5 benchmarks and view them side-by-side with interactive Chart.js visualizations showing response time distribution, memory usage over time, CPU usage, and cache performance. Include a summary table that displays all metrics with color-coded differences highlighting improvements in green and regressions in red. Provide detailed resource analysis tabs for CPU, memory, disk I/O, and database query efficiency, with export functionality for comparison data in JSON and CSV formats.
